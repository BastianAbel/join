                <h2>Processing Activities</h2>
                <p>
                    Our website includes a contact form that can be used for electronic communication. If a user uses this option, the data entered in the input form will be transmitted to us and
                    stored.
                </p>
                <p>Regardless of the chosen communication method, we collect the content of your inquiry. Your data is stored for the purpose of individual communication with you.</p>
                <h4>Legal Basis</h4>
                <p>Data processing is based on a legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).</p>
                <p>Our legitimate interest in processing your data is to enable an uncomplicated communication process.</p>
                <p>If you contact us to request an offer, the data processing is carried out to take pre-contractual measures (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR).</p>
                <h4>Recipients</h4>
                <p>Recipients of the data may include technical service providers acting as data processors for the operation and maintenance of our website.</p>
                <h4>Retention Period</h4>
                <p>Data will be deleted no later than six years after processing the contact request.</p>
                <p>If a contractual relationship arises, we are subject to statutory retention periods. These are generally 6 or 10 years for reasons of proper accounting and tax law requirements.</p>
                <h4>Mandatory or Required Provision</h4>
                <p>The provision of your personal data is voluntary. However, we can only process your request if you provide us with the necessary data and the purpose of your inquiry.</p>
                <h4>Objection</h4>
                <p>Read the information about your right to object under Art. 21 GDPR below.</p>
                <h2>Information About Your Right to Object Under Art. 21 GDPR</h2>
                <h3>Individual Right to Object</h3>
                <p>
                    You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you which is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit.
                    f GDPR (data processing based on a balancing of interests); this also applies to profiling based on these provisions within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 4 GDPR.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights, and
                    freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
                </p>
